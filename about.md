# Who am I?
My name is Benjamin and I'm currently paving my way to a career in cybersecurity, both education and hobby-wise. This blog I set up is meant to house my thoughts and projects on just about anything in the IT field. Those topics may range from embedded systems, programming projects, CTF writeups, software explorations, and so on.
