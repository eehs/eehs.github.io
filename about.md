# Who am I?
My name is Benjamin and I'm currently paving my way to a career in cybersecurity, both education and hobby-wise. This blog I set up is meant to house my thoughts and projects on just about anything in the IT field. Those topics may range from embedded and programming projects, to CTF writeups, exploring FOSS, and so on.

You can reach out to me at *benjamin.shee[at]protonmail.com*, and here's my [public key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eehs/eehs.github.io/main/assets/public.asc).
