# Who am I?
My name is Benjamin, and I'm currently paving my way to a career in IT. This blog I set up is meant to house my thoughts and projects on just about anything I find interesting in said field, be it computer networking, programming projects, CTF writeups, or exploring FOSS!

You can reach out to me at `benjamin.shee[at]protonmail.com` if you have any questions, and here's my [public key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eehs/eehs.github.io/main/assets/public.asc){:target="_blank"}!
